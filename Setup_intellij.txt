 Download IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition is an open-source version of IntelliJ IDEA, a premier IDE for Java, Scala and other JVM-based programming languages. You can download it from the official website.

2. Install the Scala plugin

Before you create or open a Scala project, you need to install the Scala plugin. For that, use the Configure → Plugins → Browse JetBrains Plugins from the Welcome Screen, or Preferences (Settings) → Plugins.


Note that Scala plugin requires restart to complete installation.

3. Setup the JDK

From the welcome screen, go to Configure → Project defaults → Project structure and add the JDK.

4. Creating a project

The easiest way to create a project is to use the Project Wizard. To use it, Click Create New Project on the Welcome Screen, then select Scala, and finally SBT Project.

5. Creating a Scala worksheet

Simply use the Create New action from context menu or press Ctrl+N on a Scala source root.



6. Creating a Scala class

 Scala classes are created via context menu action Create New, or by using the Ctrl+N shortcut..

7. Opening an SBT project

To open an SBT project in IntelliJ IDEA, go to the Welcome Screen, click Import Project, and select SBT build file that you wish to open. IntelliJ IDEA will then create a new project and import the selected file to it.

Also, you can open an SBT project without calling the Import Project action. Just click Open Project from the Welcome Screen and select an SBT build file.

8. Synchronizing SBT and IntelliJ IDEA projects

IntelliJ IDEA SBT support synchronizes the project with your build file, so when you change Scala version you're going to use, or add a library, your project is updated accordingly. For the next time, you can avoid this step by checking off the option ''Use auto-import" in Step 7.



9. Using terminal to run SBT commands

The easiest way to run SBT commands from from IntelliJ IDEA is to use the Terminal tool window via Alt+F12.
